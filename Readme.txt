# LSBA-Learn Safety Before Accident

A machine learning model that predicts the severity,seriousness,gravity of a road accident. 

## Usage 
In this today's world , where 155,622 deaths occured in India alone in the year 2022,It is crucial for one's safety to determine the conditions of the roads they plan to travel.This app powered by a machine learning model based on relevant data, helps in prediction of the severity and garvity of a road accident,if it may happen.



## Dataset
This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments for Masters research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms.
